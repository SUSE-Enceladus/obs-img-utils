Man Pages
=========

If there are changes to the API the man pages require regeneration. To re-build
the man pages use the following command where <version> is replaced with the
current version.

```shell
click-man obs-img-utils --man-version <version> -t man/man1
```

## Versions & Releases

obs-img-utils adheres to Semantic versioning; see http://semver.org/ for details.

bumpversion is used for release version management, and is configured in
setup.cfg:

```
$ bumpversion major|minor|patch
$ git push
```

Bumpversion will create a commit with version updated in all locations.
The annotated tag is created separately.

```
$ git tag -a v{version}
# git tag -a v0.0.1

# Create a message with the changes since last release and push tags.
$ git push --tags
```

## Unit & Integration Tests

All tests should pass and test coverage should remain above 90%.

The tests and coverage can be run directly via pytest.

```
$ pytest --cov=obs_img_utils
```

## Code Style

Source should pass flake8 and pycodestyle standards.

```
$ flake8 obs_img_utils
```

## Signing Commits

The repository and the code base patches sent for inclusion must be GPG
signed. See the GitHub article,
[Signing commits using GPG](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/),
for more information.
